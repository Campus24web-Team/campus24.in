                        <h2> CONTENT POLICY</h2>
                        <p> CAMPUS24 IS A FREE SERVICE FOR COMMUNICATION, SELF-EXPRESSION AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH. WE BELIEVE
                        CAMPUS24 INCREASES THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION, ENCOURAGES HEALTHY DEBATE, AND MAKES POSSIBLE
                        NEW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT CENSORING THIS CONTENT IS CONTRARY TO A SERVICE
THAT BASES ITSELF ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.</p>
                        <p> HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO UPHOLD THESE VALUES, WE NEED TO CURB ABUSES THAT THREATEN OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE
                        THIS SERVICE AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IT ENCOURAGES. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE SOME BOUNDARIES ON
                        THE TYPE OF CONTENT THAT CAN BE HOSTED WITH CAMPUS24. THE BOUNDARIES WE'VE DEFINED ARE THOSE THAT
                        BOTH COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND THAT SERVE TO ENHANCE THE SERVICE AS A WHOLE.
                        IF YOU ENCOUNTER A CONTENT THAT YOU BELIEVE VIOLATES OUR POLICIES, PLEASE REPORT IT TO US. IF THE CONTENT
OWNER HAS HIDDEN THIS LINK, YOU CAN STILL REPORT.</p>

                        PLEASE RESPECT THESE GUIDELINES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY CHANGE OUR CONTENT POLICIES SO PLEASE CHECK
                        BACK HERE. ALSO, PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN APPLYING THE POLICIES BELOW, WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS BASED ON
                        ARTISTIC, EDUCATIONAL, DOCUMENTARY, OR SCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS OR WHERE THERE ARE OTHER SUBSTANTIAL
BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC FROM NOT TAKING ACTION ON THE CONTENT.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> ADULT CONTENT:
<p>
                                    WE DON'T ALLOW ADULT CONTENT ON CAMPUS24, INCLUDING IMAGES OR VIDEOS THAT CONTAIN NUDITY OR SEXUAL
                                    ACTIVITY.
                                    WE DO NOT ALLOW ILLEGAL SEXUAL CONTENT, INCLUDING IMAGE, VIDEO OR TEXTUAL CONTENT THAT DEPICTS OR
                                    ENCOURAGES RAPE, INCEST, BESTIALITY, OR NECROPHILIA.
                                    DO NOT POST OR DISTRIBUTE PRIVATE NUDE, SEXUALLY EXPLICIT, OR NON-EXPLICIT INTIMATE AND SEXUAL IMAGES
                                    OR VIDEOS WITHOUT THE SUBJECT’S CONSENT. IF SOMEONE HAS POSTED A PRIVATE NUDE, SEXUALLY EXPLICIT, OR
NON-EXPLICIT INTIMATE AND SEXUAL IMAGE OR VIDEO OF YOU, PLEASE REPORT IT TO US HERE.</p></li>
                            <li> CHILD SAFETY:
<p>
                                    WE HAVE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARDS CONTENT THAT EXPLOITS CHILDREN. SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS
INCLUDE:</p>
                                <ul> <li> CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IMAGERY:
<p> WE WILL TERMINATE THE ACCOUNTS OF ANY USER WE FIND PUBLISHING OR DISTRIBUTING CHILD SEXUAL
ABUSE IMAGERY.</p></li>
                                    <li> PEDOPHILIA:
<p> WE DO NOT ALLOW CONTENT THAT ENCOURAGES OR PROMOTES SEXUAL ATTRACTION TOWARDS
                                        CHILDREN. FOR EXAMPLE, DO NOT CREATE CONTENT WITH GALLERIES OF IMAGES OF CHILDREN WHERE
                                        THE COLLECTION OF IMAGES OR TEXT ACCOMPANYING THE IMAGES IS SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE, AND DO
NOT PUBLISH CONTENT OF A SEXUAL NATURE INVOLVING AN UNDERAGE PARTICIPANT.</p></li> </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li> HATE SPEECH:
<p> OUR PRODUCTS ARE PLATFORMS FOR FREE EXPRESSION, BUT WE DON’T PERMIT HATE SPEECH. HATE SPEECH IS
                                CONTENT THAT PROMOTES OR CONDONES VIOLENCE AGAINST OR HAS THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF INCITING
                                HATRED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE OR ETHNIC ORIGIN, RELIGION,
                                DISABILITY, AGE, NATIONALITY, VETERAN STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER, GENDER IDENTITY, OR ANY
OTHER CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION OR MARGINALIZATION.</p></li>
                            <li> CRUDE CONTENT:
<p> DON'T POST CONTENT JUST TO BE SHOCKING OR GRAPHIC. FOR EXAMPLE, COLLECTIONS OF CLOSE-UP IMAGES OF
                                GUNSHOT WOUNDS OR ACCIDENT SCENES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OR COMMENTARY WOULD VIOLATE
THIS POLICY.</p></li>
                            <li> VIOLENCE:
<p> IT'S NOT OKAY TO POST VIOLENT OR GORY CONTENT THAT'S PRIMARILY INTENDED TO BE SHOCKING, SENSATIONAL,
                                OR GRATUITOUS. IF POSTING GRAPHIC CONTENT IN A NEWS, DOCUMENTARY, SCIENTIFIC, OR ARTISTIC CONTEXT,
                                PLEASE BE MINDFUL TO PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. IN
                                SOME CASES, CONTENT MAY BE SO VIOLENT OR SHOCKING THAT NO AMOUNT OF CONTEXT WILL ALLOW THAT
                                CONTENT TO REMAIN ON OUR PLATFORMS. LASTLY, DON'T ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO COMMIT SPECIFIC ACTS OF
VIOLENCE.</p></li>
                            <li> TERRORIST CONTENT:
<p> WE DO NOT PERMIT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS TO USE CAMPUS24 FOR ANY PURPOSE, INCLUDING
                                RECRUITMENT. CAMPUS24 ALSO STRICTLY PROHIBITS CONTENT RELATED TO TERRORISM, SUCH AS CONTENT THAT
                                PROMOTES TERRORIST ACTS, INCITES VIOLENCE, OR CELEBRATES TERRORIST ATTACKS.
                                IF POSTING CONTENT RELATED TO TERRORISM FOR AN EDUCATIONAL, DOCUMENTARY, SCIENTIFIC, OR ARTISTIC
                                PURPOSE, BE MINDFUL TO PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION SO VIEWERS UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT. GRAPHIC

                                CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, DON'T POST DEATH THREATS AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE AND

                                THE NECESSARY CONSENT FROM THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES. IF SOMEONE HAS POSTED AN IMAGE OR VIDEO
                                OF A MINOR WITHOUT NECESSARY CONSENT, PLEASE REPORT IT TO US HERE. ALSO, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT IN
                                MOST CASES, INFORMATION THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE ON THE INTERNET OR IN PUBLIC RECORDS IS
NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PRIVATE OR CONFIDENTIAL UNDER OUR POLICIES.</p></li>
