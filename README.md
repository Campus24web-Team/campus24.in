# MISSION

## Our mission is to create the Virtual Campus which would enable our users to enjoy a perfect campus life by striking a balance between fun and productivity.
## Our platform will not only unify the various departments in a campus, but entire student communities in a region. We will bring a sense of belongingness among students of all campuses.
## Campus24 will revolutionize the interconnections between college departments fueling collaboration, entrepreneurial spirit, talent development, learning experience and team spirit.
## It was surveyed that about 60% professionals get a job through recommendations via seniors and batchmates. Our unique idea of bringing alumni and batches together would exponentially increase oneâ€™s network and help them remain connected to their alma mater forever.

# VISION

## Our Vision is to create a self-sustaining unicorn within the next 10 years and be the pioneer in the market of community focused social utility platforms.
## Not only college/uni, our aim is to unite all the schools as well as college/uni campuses in India within these 10 years and become the all in one platform every student in India will need and appreciate.
